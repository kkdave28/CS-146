1.  The command 'cat x y > y' would result in unexpected behavior because the file y is open for reading and we are trying to 
    read from the file and write to the file at the same time in the same operation which will result in the contents of y to be purged
    and contents of x to be written to y.

2.  The command 'cat x >> x' will try to append the contents of x to x. This is because in the same operation, we have requested the file to open for
    reading and writing at the same time. This will result in x to be purged, meaning that there is nothing to be written to the stdout and then the previous contents
    of x will be appended to x itself.
